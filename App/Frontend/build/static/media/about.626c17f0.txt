Woo Woo Network was imagined by Kimberlee Klein. She works with those who have experienced pregnancy loss and in her programs she opens people up to their own spiritual world. After releasing their grief and creating a new life after loss, her clients are eager to continue with their spiritual work.

When looking at the market she found there was no real one which promoted healers in a powerful and easy way. Recognizing that each healer is responsible for creating their own website and doing their own marketing, she found that a marketplace would be of service to the world. Extraordinary gifts are found in so many corners of the world and Woo Woo Network is eager to help as many people to find their way through all sorts of journeys people are on.

At Woo Woo Network we believe that the work that healers do is invaluable! We are committed to help healers build a sustainable business using our platform. 

These healing tools provided can enable clients to release and deal with life issues in a peaceful way. Sometimes impacting generations to come.

We also give access to a journal area so clients can keep their private thoughts and experience in one safe place.

Oftentimes little shifts with a healer can add up to big impact a few weeks after a session. Capturing this impact brings value to the client.

We also encourage people to try different healers on the site as different methodologies can tackle different issues in a new way each time. 

This also gives you access to try new tools!
